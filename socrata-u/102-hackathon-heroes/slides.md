# What is a _hackathon_ anyway?

## _hack_: 

1. _n._ Originally, a quick job that produces what is needed, but not well.
2. _n._ An incredibly good, and perhaps very time-consuming, piece of work that produces exactly what is needed.

1. Identify _high-impact_ events
2. Support those with _awesome people_
3. Provide financial support if it can _magnify_ our impact

## What makes a high-impact event?

* Focus on _making a civic impact_ through open data
* _Target_ market & customer
* A _chance to influence_ the community or customer
